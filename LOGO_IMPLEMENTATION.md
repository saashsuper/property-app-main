# PROMAN Logo Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a CSS-based logo solution for PROMAN, replacing the original Steex logo images with a modern, gradient-based text logo.

## What Was Done

- **Features**: 
  - Gradient text effect (blue to purple)
  - Responsive sizing (sm, default, lg, xl)
  - Optional subtitle "Property Management"
  - Hover effects

### 2. Updated Layout Files
- **Topbar**: `resources/views/layouts/topbar.blade.php`
- **Sidebar**: `resources/views/layouts/sidebar.blade.php`
- **Changes**: Replaced all logo image references with the new component

### 3. Logo Specifications
- **Font**: Poppins (fallback to system fonts)
- **Gradient**: Blue (#667eea) to Purple (#764ba2)
- **Sizes**: 
  - Small: 1.2rem
